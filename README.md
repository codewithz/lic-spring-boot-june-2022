**CascadeType.PERSIST**: When persisting an entity, also persist the entities held in its fields. We suggest a liberal application of this cascade rule, because if the EntityManager finds a field that references a new entity during the flush, and the field does not use CascadeType.PERSIST, it is an error.

**CascadeType.REMOVE**: When deleting an entity, it also deletes the entities held in this field.

**CascadeType.REFRESH:** When refreshing an entity, also refresh the entities held in this field.

**CascadeType.MERGE:** When merging entity state, also merge the entities held in this field.
